	<p>Chris likes to talk about this thing one of his teachers told him in college:
		that a song, rather than an isolated thing, is just a portion of a larger moment
		that continues both before and after what you are hearing. That sounds like some
		real art school shit to me. When I say things to Chris like, &ldquo;That sounds
		like some real art school shit to me,&rdquo; he becomes a sage fortress, smiling
		slightly, saying little to nothing, not engaging. It could be a diplomatic measure,
		but it also reads like he has nothing to prove. And when he does send me <em>Gymnast</em>,
		I can&rsquo;t help but hear what I thought was &ldquo;some art school shit&rdquo;
		becoming a real, legitimate idea that I cannot deny. The immediacy of the tracks&rsquo;
		beginnings and endings. The effortlessness dynamic transitions. The simultaneous
		urgency and continuity.</p>

	<h2>Club Neurosis </h2>
	<h6> By Faith Harding</h6>

	<p> I find it impossible to talk about life and music in Oakland without first
		addressing the devastating Ghost Ship fire. Almost four months since, the heartache
		I feel remains visceral. Having arrived at the venue just twenty minutes after
		the fire started, and having lost two dear friends amongst the thirty-six
		incredible lives lost that night, I can&rsquo;t fully articulate the combined
		feelings of grief, despair and fear of what could have been. The scope of the
		tragedy has been immense and unbearable; it has affected the lives of countless
		people around the world. </p>

	<h2>Living Well: Turiya </h2>


		<p>Bjork has always led me to consider new intentions or paths to travel down in music. </i>Post</i> was
			one of the first CDs I ever owned, I listened to it over and over&mdash;the magical narrative of
			&quot;Hyperballad&quot; refreshed the way I thought about lyrics. In songs like &quot;Joga&quot; I was in awe of a
			new type of intensity within her string arrangements. But the specific type of vulnerability and
			intimacy in the album <i>Vespertine</i> inspired me to focus on my own kind of interior emotional
			worlds in my electronic compositions.<br><br></p>

		<center><img src="enayet_bed.jpg" style="width:50%;"></center>
		<p><i>Easy 2 Find is a label that promotes the exploration of both inner and
			outer experiences. And what about the inner&rsquo;s effect on the outer?
			When you see someone at a party, when you see someone performing, there is
			always one place they have come from, and one place they will return: their
			home. Living Well is a feature that explores this hidden realm that informs
			and influences all else that you do and see, and how individuals choose to
			curate their relationship to that realm. <br><br></p>

				<strong>E2F: I hadn&rsquo;t thought about it, until you started talking about
					having to move around a lot, but I grew up under joint custody that was really
					chaotic, and I would always be forgetting shit, and I also became obsessed with
					making sure my room was perfect, when I finally got to&hellip;</strong><br><br>
					EK: That makes a lot of sense. <br><br></p>

											A mix by Jordan Alper:<br><br>
											"A sampling of contemporary Balearic sounds and colors from around the
											globe. I've been thinking a lot about islands/sunsets as platforms for
											shared sincerity, and ways we can abstract and democratize site-specificity.
											Hopefully this mix makes you feel warm. :]"

										<h2>6th House</h2>
										<h6>By Faith Harding</h6>

										<p>
											Pandora Radio entered my life when I was 15, when my musical appetite was at
											its most voracious. I devoured songs and albums with a feverish, hormonal gusto
											that most likely was meant to be used for the sex I wasn&rsquo;t having. I remember
											well how Pandora was marketed. This is because I was young, and foolish&mdash;
											and I believed in the promises Pandora made.<br><br>

											<h2>Guided Meditation</h2>

											<p>When listening back to a track, looking at the Ableton screen can become a bit of
												a distraction and can stop you from paying attention to the sound of the mix alone.
												Try this exercise: Before beginning playback, turn the brightness on your computer
												all the way down. Then turn off all the lights in your room and close your
												blackout curtains. Slowly remove all of your clothes and create with them a soft
												surface to lie on. Cover your body LIBERALLY with a ROOM TEMPERATURE oil. Close
												your eyes and pay attention to your breathing. Try to slow it down as much as
												possible, moving from a deep to a shallow movement. Try to make it as shallow as
												possible. Soon, you will notice you are not breathing at all. Notice if you still
												even feel yourself inside your own body. No? That&rsquo;s right, you are no longer
												a body, you are void of person. You are free of both your objecthood and subjecthood.
												There is nothing left to create, and nothing left to listen to. You are finally
												liberated. Congratulations.
