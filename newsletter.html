	<p>Chris likes to talk about this thing one of his teachers told him in college:
		that a song, rather than an isolated thing, is just a portion of a larger moment
		that continues both before and after what you are hearing. That sounds like some
		real art school shit to me. When I say things to Chris like, &ldquo;That sounds
		like some real art school shit to me,&rdquo; he becomes a sage fortress, smiling
		slightly, saying little to nothing, not engaging. It could be a diplomatic measure,
		but it also reads like he has nothing to prove. And when he does send me <em>Gymnast</em>,
		I can&rsquo;t help but hear what I thought was &ldquo;some art school shit&rdquo;
		becoming a real, legitimate idea that I cannot deny. The immediacy of the tracks&rsquo;
		beginnings and endings. The effortlessness dynamic transitions. The simultaneous
		urgency and continuity.</p>
	<p> Damn it. </p>
	<p> I think that if you are in a good relationship, one that challenges you,
		&ldquo;<em>Damn it&rdquo;</em> is a thought you have a lot&mdash;like when you
		realize you are wrong, or realize that the thing that drives you crazy about this
		person also turns out to be their best quality. The same person who walks down
		Driggs Ave. and makes a joke about &ldquo;smiggling Driggs&rdquo; &#40;<em>smiggling&hellip;Driggs??
			REALLY???&#41; </em>is also the person who starts an album with three smooth
			house jams and then cuts to a beatless ambient track called &ldquo;Harry
			Potter.&rdquo; And says the song is not about Harry Potter, but our friend
			who dressed up as Harry Potter for Halloween. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.
			None of it makes sense. NONE OF THIS MAKES SENSE! Why am I yelling? Because
			I&rsquo;m upset that in spite of it all, I still really like it. I like nonsense.
			This person made nonsense good.</p>
	<p> Damn it.</p>
	<p> Chris looks like a very normal person but he&rsquo;s actually a mix between
		an alien and a droid. The Adidas sweatshirts and baseball caps are a good disguise.
		If you are just trying to have a nice time at Trans-Pecos or what have you, you
		wouldn&rsquo;t even notice that this man is actually out to harvest your DNA
		and use it to generate terrible puns. </p>
	<p> This album looks like a very normal dance release but upon further investigation,
		it is a little baffling. There are some really delightful grooves that would
		be lovely things to hear in the club for a solid 6 minute stretch but Chris
		leaves them at around 2 or 3. The Normal in me wants to say to him, &ldquo;Why
		would you do this? Why can&rsquo;t you just make this a standard length? Why
		can&rsquo;t you be like the other kids!!??&rdquo; There is really no point in
		asking because I already know he would smile like a damn Yoda from Massachusetts
		and say, &ldquo;This is as long as the track wants to be.&rdquo; Or something
		like that. But again, damn it. He&rsquo;s right. This album is just as long as
		it should be, and every moment is what it should be. This album feels so happy
		just being itself. Its weird, 24-minute self, with its explosions of odd beats
		and its cinematic, buzzy, washed up outro, with its two tracks that are called
		games instead of tracks. &#40;What the hell does that mean, Game 1&#63; Game
		2&#63;&#63;&#63; I mean, if I&rsquo;m being honest with myself, I know exactly
		what it means. Somehow. Damn it.&#41; </p>
	<p> Recently Chris played me a thing he made that he said was an edit of Wayne
		Wonder&rsquo;s &ldquo;No Letting Go.&rdquo; He had taken like, a four bar phrase
		out of the original track, put a very disorienting grain delay on it, and looped
		it for 3 minutes. The only change that really occurs is that the grain delay
		becomes more and more intense, until it is just cacophony. And as he plays it
		he just looks at me with that same silent smile that he dons when he warns me
		about the dangers of &ldquo;smiggling Driggs,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s like, what
		am I supposed to say about this, Chris? That it&rsquo;s good? </p>
	<p> Because it is. </p>
	<p> Damn it. </p>

	<h2>Bay Report </h2>
	<h6> By Gabriel Ross</h6>

	<p> I find it impossible to talk about life and music in Oakland without first
		addressing the devastating Ghost Ship fire. Almost four months since, the heartache
		I feel remains visceral. Having arrived at the venue just twenty minutes after
		the fire started, and having lost two dear friends amongst the thirty-six
		incredible lives lost that night, I can&rsquo;t fully articulate the combined
		feelings of grief, despair and fear of what could have been. The scope of the
		tragedy has been immense and unbearable; it has affected the lives of countless
		people around the world. </p>

	<p> In addition to being two of the most gifted producers and DJs in the area,
		<a target="_blank" href="https://cherushii.bandcamp.com/music">Chelsea Faith
			(aka. Cherushii)</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://nacktmusic.bandcamp.com/music">Johnny Igaz (aka. Nackt) </a>
			were both hugely important friends and mentors for me. Their passing has been a
			massive blow to the Bay Area dance music scene. They are true heroes of the
			community. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NkDh_vML_M">Cherushii&rsquo;s live PA</a>
			sets were second to none. Watching Chelsea operate those huge tables of gear
			was pure joy; something I looked forward to for weeks following gigs announcements.
			I owe so much to Chelsea personally: she taught me how to mix records, she
			gave me my first DJ gig, and she helped me establish my monthly dance party.
			Her guidance and skill cannot be understated. The Los Angeles based label
			100% Silk recently reissued <a target="_blank" href="https://cherushii.bandcamp.com/album/memory-of-water">Cherushii&rsquo;s <i>Memories of Water</i></a>
			and <a target="_blank" href="https://nacktmusic.bandcamp.com/album/virex">Nackt&rsquo;s <i>Virex</i> tapes</a>.
			I highly recommend spending some time with both records. Additionally, Johnny&rsquo;s
			stellar <a target="_blank" href="https://theniteowldiner.bandcamp.com/album/night-system-diner-008"><i>Night System</i> 12&rdquo;</a>
			came out on the Nite Owl Diner in mid-January. The record highlights Johnny&rsquo;s
			dexterity on a range of hardware and showcases his collaborations with fellow
			Bay Area artists <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/kendig">Jason
				Kendig</a> (of Honey Soundsystem) and <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/cm-4">CM-4</a>,
				one of my favorite local artists. Their crew, Outpost, just released <a target="_blank"
				href="https://outposttrax.bandcamp.com/album/outpost-split-series-001-nackt-michael-claus">a
					split tape from Nackt and fellow SF producer, Michael Claus</a>. Both records bang HARD. </p>

	<p> I remind myself that Johnny and Chelsea were only two of thirty six people
		who passed that night. The fire broke out early, and those present at the time
		were the ones who would have been setting up the party, doing the heavy lifting
		and showing up early to support their friends. So many deeply talented and
		creative people were lost.</p>

	<p> While the response from the city government has been misguided and disheartening,
		the response from the community has been so encouraging and inspiring. Within
		days of the tragedy, numerous tributes, benefits, and showcases were organized
		around the Bay, with all proceeds going to various charities and individual
		funds. No one missed a beat in terms of bringing artists and dancers together
		to honor our friends and celebrate their lives. </p>

	<p> Organizers naturally turned to fully licensed, legal spaces for these shows&mdash;the
		warehouse scene that shaped my nightlife in the East Bay has unsurprisingly
		dissolved following the fire. I personally have had no desire to go to those
		spaces in the past few months, and I have not seen any publicized parties in
		the usual spaces around the city. I continue to be haunted by the unsafe conditions
		I regularly overlooked. While I miss the thrill of venturing to all corners
		of the city, not knowing the location until hours before and staying out all
		night in new, eccentric venues, it feels almost selfish to speak in these terms
		considering all those who relied on these spaces primarily as a home and vital
		source of community. Residents continue to be displaced, losing their homes
		and belongings in subsequent evictions and city closures. The impacts of this
		unspeakable tragedy continue to unfold across the Bay Area and around the world.</p>

	<p> In the face of these challenging circumstances it is a great consolation to
		see promoters maximizing Oakland&rsquo;s fully legal spaces in new and exciting
		ways. Oakland does not have any true clubs (in the vein of San Francisco&rsquo;s
		<a target="_blank" href="http://sfpublicworks.org/">Public Works</a>, <a target="_blank"
		href="http://www.feightsf.com/">F8</a>,
		or smaller spots like the former <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/222-Hyde-88603085937/">222 Hyde</a>)
		and most of the mid-size live rooms operate as bar spaces first and foremost.
		Nonetheless, I continue to discover new parties popping up regularly. <a target="_blank"
		href="https://soundcloud.com/clubchai">Club Chai</a>
		has worked tirelessly for over the past year to bring the finest in club DJs
		from around the world. They have moved between numerous spaces but recently
		started up at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.starlinesocialclub.com/StarlineSite/">Starline Social Club</a>.
		Located between Uptown and West Oakland, Starline has emerged as a real hub
		for different crews and nights, and it has provided an amazing home for my
		monthly party, Palace. This monthly has been a hugely positive undertaking
		for me, and It has been an immense privilege to host a range of new and longtime
		friends. I hope that people have found the night to be a welcoming and comfortable
		place to dance and relax. I have to give a special shout out to Kate &amp; Miro,
		Ian &amp; Danny, Myles, Marlena, Turiya, Nastia, Divya, Lekha, Earl, Taye, Phil &amp; Manny
		who have all played the party since it relaunched in Oakland last November.</p>

	<p>I want to highlight some of the many amazing, hard-working artists here in
		the Bay Area. <a target="_blank" href="https://bourgeoisspeedball.bandcamp.com/">Bourgeois Speedball</a>
		have been my favorite recent discovery. Their live set at Palace 7 completely
		blew me away. They set up a table full of hardware and improvise this insane
		blend of broken footwork, house, and chopped up field records from protests
		around the Bay Area. One of their members also makes very rad tracks under
		the moniker <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/katsy-pline">Katsy Pline</a>.
		Cassidy Martin, aka <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/cm-4">CM-4</a>,
		continues to make some of the most satisfying house and techno around. Cassidy
		and Johnny have been real inspirations for me to work more on hardware production. <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/bsidebrujas">B-Side Brujas</a>
		are quite possibly the coolest crew doing it today. Their all-vinyl souldies/funk
		sets have left me screaming with joy on the dancefloor. They play all the time
		and recently moved their monthly night over to <a target="_blank"
		href="https://www.instagram.com/starline_social_club/?hl=en">Starline</a>.
		Do not miss an opportunity to hear them DJ. Big shout out to the man Adept,
		the finest DJ operating above 165 BPM and a resident DJ at the weekly drum and
		bass party <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1517510748473014/">Stamina
			Sundays</a>. <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/rochesolos">Roche</a>,
		aka Ben Winans, makes the trippiest swirling house jams. Check out the
		track &lsquo;Conge&rsquo; and &lsquo;Axt&rsquo; on <a target="_blank"
		href="https://jacktonerecords.bandcamp.com/album/axt">his 12&rdquo; for Jacktone Records</a>.
		Ben also hosts the weekly Monday night party <a target="_blank"
		href="https://soundcloud.com/runthelengthofyourwildness">Run The Length of Your Wildness</a>
		which he founded with Cherushii almost two years ago. Ben and friends continue
		to highlight the many brilliant local DJs and often offer folks like me a chance
		to play out for the first time.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Wildness and the network of local promoter crews have been a deeply formative
		part of my nightlife experience. My move to the Bay lined up with the first few
		parties by <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/sure_thing">Sure
			Thing</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://breadsf.club/">Bread</a>, and
			<a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/parameter_sf">Parameter</a>.
			Operating primarily out of the essential SoMa venue, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.feightsf.com/">F8</a>,
			these crews have consistently curated the finest lineups, often collaborating
			with one another, and always including local friends on the bills. Sure Thing&rsquo;s
			party with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.omarsdetroit.us/index.php">Omar S</a>
			in February 2015 and the extended B2B set from <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/kmfh">Kyle Hall</a> &amp; <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/jaydaniel">Jay Daniel</a>
			in March 2016 top the list of my favorite nights out. Moreover, these nights
			helped introduce me to a truly welcoming and diverse community. I rejoice in
			knowing I can go out alone and inevitably end up running into friends on the
			dancefloor. </p>

	<p>I also want to shout out Alex and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lowergrandradio.com/stream/">Lower
		Grand Radio</a>, a DIY radio station that recently set up shop in a space on 40th,
		shared with the super cool <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/unitypress/?hl=en">Unity
			Press/Skateboards</a>. For the record collectors, be sure to check out
			<a target="_blank" href="http://www.parkblvdrecords.com/">Park Blvd Records</a>,
			a beautiful shop on the east side of the lake with a remarkably thorough collection
			of rap cassettes and vinyl. I&rsquo;m talking subdivided sections for Miami,
			Atlanta, Baton Rouge, Houston, etc.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Sending out much love from the Bay Area! Encouraging everyone to support your
		friends, support local artists, show up to events,speak up to the right people
		about unsafe venue conditions, work to make community spaces safer, and tell
		your friends and family how much you love them!! </p>

	<h2>In the Garden, <br>
		Everything&rsquo;s Going On </h2>

		<h6>Sally Decker on Bjork's <i>Verspertine</i></h6>

		<p>Bjork has always led me to consider new intentions or paths to travel down in music. </i>Post</i> was
			one of the first CDs I ever owned, I listened to it over and over&mdash;the magical narrative of
			&quot;Hyperballad&quot; refreshed the way I thought about lyrics. In songs like &quot;Joga&quot; I was in awe of a
			new type of intensity within her string arrangements. But the specific type of vulnerability and
			intimacy in the album <i>Vespertine</i> inspired me to focus on my own kind of interior emotional
			worlds in my electronic compositions.<br><br>

			I first listened to <i>Vespertine</i> my junior year of high school. I grew obsessed with the album, went
			through a phase where I couldn&rsquo;t listen to anything else&mdash;everything seemed lackluster in
			comparison. My relationship with <i>Vespertine</i> emerged during the winter; the landscape outside
			perfectly matched the sonic world of the album. Since this initial deep connection, I have
			returned to it numerous times, and whenever I go back through a stage of listening, the same
			relationship I initially had is almost exactly reborn: an obsessive, this-and-only-this type of
			attachment, and a distinct feeling of solace in the world created by the album.<br><br>

			There is power in the deep feeling of introversion in <i>Vespertine</i>. The melodies feel like you could
			build a home in them, the ones you rely on in moments of complete exhaustion: when you start
			the commute, when you lay down to sleep but your mind is still racing. The pacing of the songs
			can echo a kind of emotional acrobatics. In &quot;Undo,&quot; for instance, suddenly you are stopped in
			your tracks by a section of lush strings and choir and there is some mysterious shift, you didn&#39;t
			register it before but now it&#39;s right in front of you, looming sad and bright. Each song is a secret.
			In the music I make now I attempt to communicate an attentiveness to self and emotion; I want
			to demand the listener&#39;s serious focus. This was something I encountered first with this album: a
			type of focus that comes from the intensity of inward reflection.<br><br>

			The emotive intimacy in Bjork's lyrics contributes to this type of inward vulnerability. &quot;Cocoon&quot;
			feels like it is whispered from under covers, a cold winter morning outside of the walls of the
			house: &quot;He slides inside / half awake half asleep / we faint back into sleephood.&quot; Bjork
			communicates her predicaments in a way that reflects the complexities of overlapping emotional
			states. &quot;It&#39;s Not Up To You,&quot; for instance, explores the process of chasing a day that feels good.
			The seemingly hopeless refrain erupts, but it is packed with a joyful mystery: &quot;It&#39;s not up to you,
			oh it never really was.&quot; The longing for something bright, something meaningful, also appears in
			&quot;Aurora&quot;: &quot;Looking hard for / moments of shine.&quot; Or the magical intimacy of &quot;Sun In My
			Mouth,&quot; lines packed with intuitive imagery that follow gorgeous reaching melodic moments:
			&quot;To dash against darkness / in the sleeping curves of my body.&quot;<br><br>

			The emotional character of these songs is also translated sonically: little glitches catch you by
			surprise; shuffles of noise feel anxious, but are accompanied by warm synths. When I was first
			creating my own synth sounds I initially tried to emulate the way the electronics work in this
			album; the sounds that I was searching for were based on this type of world. A perfect example
			is the tactile, crackly beat in &quot;Cocoon&quot;&mdash;the way that these sounds feel like something, or remind
			you of a specific texture or a memory of using your body&mdash;the physicality of the sound was
			completely new for me. Synths take on a heartbeat-like pulsing, or float in a strange atmosphere;
			the sound of footsteps in snow takes you to a specific day you trudged through the cold on your
			own, the sweat building up underneath your coat while your fingers slowly turn numb. The cold
			dusk of winter, the blue afterthought of sun.<br><br>

			In <i>Vespertine</i> I encountered electronics in the context of pop music that didn&#39;t necessarily
			contribute to a &quot;melody&quot; or a &quot;beat,&quot; but acted as an element of arrangement. Glitchy sounds exist
			alongside a haunting melody Bjork sings, cut-up samples of breath are scattered in between
			melodic phrases. And in hearing the way that intimacy is conveyed through electronic sounds, I
			realized that I could shape sounds to craft a very personal, introspective space.<br><br>

			The wintery quality of the album is also a crucial piece of inspiration. Something in the character
			of these sounds made me feel like I was in the mindset I retreat to only in the winter, even if I
			was listening to it during some other time of the year. This led me to bring out emotional aspects
			of specific places or time periods in my own sonic approach. In
			<a target="_blank" href="https://multanox.bandcamp.com/releases">the self-titled <i>Multa Nox</i> tape</a>
			specifically, I explore the qualities of seasons and weather as they relate to my mood and
			relationship to the world.<br><br>

			<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/257341319&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>
			<br><br>

			With the track &quot;traces,&quot; for instance, I strived to explore the way your internal emotional world
			can become projected onto an outside landscape. Each day the external world carries a different
			version of what you project onto it, but sometimes your internal state feels like it is dissolving
			almost completely into the outer landscape, like you&rsquo;re looking out at a reflection of yourself that
			you built unintentionally. &quot;<a target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/multa-nox/rainswell">rainswell</a>&quot; is sort of the antithesis of that process. That track came
			from thinking about times when I carry a feeling of sadness, something dark, and the outside
			world matches the inside place exactly&mdash;a grey day, for example, or rain. When the outside
			world actually empowers that sadness, you dig into it deeper and don&rsquo;t mind being there, you
			start to feel encouraged by the intensity and create the space to feel those emotions.<br><br>

			I have a sticky note on my desktop where I type out to-do lists, schedules for my days. At the top
			of it I&rsquo;ve had a Bjork quote typed out in bold for a handful of years now: &quot;If you wake up in the
			middle of the night and you go in the garden, everything&rsquo;s going on out there that you wouldn&rsquo;t
			know about.&quot; This is from an interview with <i>NME</i> that she did in 2001, talking about <i>Vespertine</i>
			and the type of mood she was trying to get at with the album. I love this image, and in my mind
			I envision this scene playing out on some snowy January night. It is this kind of intention that has
			guided me in my music-making: the process of searching for a secret occurring underneath the
			surface, or an encounter with yourself amidst a moment in solitude, letting yourself into another
			world built from a new perspective that was once hidden, that slowly emerged in the middle of
			the night.<br><br>

			<i>Sally Decker performs as Multa Nox. Her work explores the emotional potential
			of sounds as healing or portals of connection, and works to impart a type of
			focus towards one's own internal world. Her first full-length release, 'Living
			Pearl' is now available on cassette and digital formats via NNA Tapes. She is
			beginning her graduate studies at Oakland's Mills College this coming fall--and
			we will miss her!</i>

		<p><i>Easy 2 Find is a label that promotes the exploration of both inner and
			outer experiences. And what about the inner&rsquo;s effect on the outer?
			When you see someone at a party, when you see someone performing, there is

			home. Living Well is a feature that explores this hidden realm that informs
			and influences all else that you do and see, and how individuals choose to
			curate their relationship to that realm. <br><br>

			Enayet Kabir is a true renaissance man, musician, DJ, visual artist, technology
			wizard, scent connoisseur, and good friend, all in one. His relationship to home
			has long been one of flux: he was born in Bangladesh, attended school in Malaysia,
			and moved to New York as an adult, never really having a solid space to live
			in for an extended period of time. Now that he has set his roots down in some
			form, his attention to his living space is paramount to his sense of well-being.
			After many enjoyable, comfortable hangs at his apartment, he was an obvious
			candidate for our first interview! :) </i>

		<p><strong>E2F: What role does your room play in your life?</strong><br><br>
			EK: My room plays an enormous role in my life for several reasons. One of the
			main ones is that I work out of my room, so it&rsquo;s a space in which I need
			to be productive but also be able to relax. So a big part of how I think about
			my room is in regards to how I can &ldquo;switch the mode,&rdquo; you know? It
			can be very difficult, and I&rsquo;ve had a lot of difficulty figuring that out:
			being in my room and thinking &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awake now, I need to work,&rdquo;
			or sometimes I&rsquo;ve been working and I need to wind down&hellip;but I&rsquo;m
			still in the same space.
			I kind of see my room as an extension of my headspace. I&rsquo;m definitely the
			kind of person&hellip;like, my head is very cluttered all the time, and so any
			amount of clutter in my physical space means I just can&rsquo;t get anything done.
			So I have everything within easy reach. I have compartments in my compartments.
			Smaller containers in larger containers.<br><br>
			I moved to this space about a year ago. Before that I was at another apartment
			for about two years, and that last apartment was the first time I had the same
			room for more than three months at a time. I was used to constantly redoing my
			room in like, two days and thinking, &ldquo;this is what I&rsquo;m doing for three
			months,&rdquo; over and over, and when I moved into my last place, I thought &ldquo;I
			want easy access to all of my things.&rdquo; And that mentality evolved to moving
			here. And I know exactly what I want and what is missing. It&rsquo;s my headspace.<br><br>

			<strong>E2F: So you feel like your room is a way for you to emphasize how you
				want things to be organized in the rest of your life?</strong><br><br>
				EK: Absolutely.<br><br>
			</p>
			<center><img class="pic1" src="enayet_rack.png" style="width:50%;"></center>

			<p>
				<strong>E2F: I hadn&rsquo;t thought about it, until you started talking about
					having to move around a lot, but I grew up under joint custody that was really
					chaotic, and I would always be forgetting shit, and I also became obsessed with
					making sure my room was perfect, when I finally got to&hellip;</strong><br><br>
					EK: That makes a lot of sense. <br><br>

					<strong>E2F: Yeah, I&rsquo;ve only started realizing how much it&rsquo;s affected
						me recently. But I feel like control over space&hellip;when you haven&rsquo;t
						had that, it becomes really important.</strong><br><br>
						EK: It&rsquo;s very much a feedback loop thing&hellip;I clean regularly. I really
						do start to feel like my room is hurting sometimes&hellip;<br><br>

						<strong>E2F: Awwww!</strong><br><br>
					</p>



					<p>
						EK: &hellip;you know when things are out of order, not feeling easy, I think&hellip;  <br>

						One of my things is a Designated Clutter Zone. I think it&rsquo;s very easy to
						throw things on your desk and I really try to avoid that. The thing is it drives
						me crazy when I leave home, knowing that I&rsquo;m going to come back to a mess,
						because that&rsquo;s the worst. So I have to clean my desk before I leave.<br><br>

						<strong>E2F: Totally. Same.</strong><br><br>
						EK: So the Designated Clutter Zone is that thing over there. That&rsquo;s where,
						if I ever feel like I&rsquo;m holding something and I&rsquo;m in a mindset where
						it&rsquo;s like, sometimes you just feel like you need to just throw something
						somewhere&hellip;<br><br>

						<strong>E2F: &hellip;right, or you just don&rsquo;t want to deal with it right
							now.</strong><br><br>
							EK: &hellip;so if later I can&rsquo;t find something I&rsquo;ll check the Designated
							Clutter Zone, and it&rsquo;ll be there. I try not to let it get too cluttered.<br><br>
							On the topic of <em>clutter</em>&hellip;.you&rsquo;ll notice that there&rsquo;s
							a bunch of random stuff in the corners&hellip;a little bit messy, but there&rsquo;s
							a method to the madness. That looks like a bunch of random shit&hellip;these are
							my <em>sound diffusers.</em> Because I&rsquo;m not gonna like, set up a bunch of
							fucking panels in my room, because I don&rsquo;t have time&hellip;but getting
							heavy shit in these corners where bass gets trapped&hellip;a bunch of different
							sized, different shaped objects, in the corners, makes a big difference&hellip;objects
							in shelves&hellip;That&rsquo;s also why in that corner, there&rsquo;s also like,
							knick-knacks going into the folds.<br><br>

							<strong>E2F: So even your clutter has purpose. That&rsquo;s the way
								that it doesn&rsquo;t feel like clutter. Because I feel like when
								clutter gets frustrating is when it&rsquo;s like, what is the use
								of this? </strong><br><br>
							EK: Yeah like, why is that there?<br><br>

							<strong>E2F: What is the <em>point </em>of it<em>?</em> So if you
								say like, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s where the clutter goes,&rdquo; then
								at least it has that&hellip;</strong><br><br>

							<strong>But something else I want thinking about, is when you said
								you feel like your room is &ldquo;hurting&rdquo; sometimes, and I
								feel like it&rsquo;s interesting&hellip;I never thought about the
								fact that your room needs to take care of you. It&rsquo;s where you
								feel comfortable. But you have to take care of it so that it can
								do that for you. If you start neglecting it, you&rsquo;re going
								to start feeling really shitty in your room. It&rsquo;s like a
								relationship, almost.</strong><br><br>
							EK: I&rsquo;m really big on the idea that being a cyborg is a central
							part of being human. I think our relationship to technology is what
							makes us human. We always have a tendency, when we talk about technology,
							to think of the most cutting edge thing that people have made, so
							we think of digital technology or something like that. But really,
							we&rsquo;re people because like&hellip;picking up a stick to knock
							a piece of fruit off of a tree&hellip;<br><br>

							<strong>E2F: Yeah, that was the beginning of it&hellip;</strong><br><br>
							EK: &hellip;and that&rsquo;s an extension of human facility, right?
							Like, writing is an extension of memory. Cooking is an extension of
							your digestive system. These are all technologies. And so your <em>room</em>,
							your <em>home</em>, is a technology. Right? That you extend yourself with.
							And so I think of my room the same way I think of my notebooks, and the way
							I organize folders on my computer desktop. It&rsquo;s like, the idea of
							like semantic priming&hellip;how we as humans retain things in our
							memory by placing a reference into something else. We do that with
							other people. Like when we&rsquo;re talking with people and we have
							the tendency to be like, &ldquo;Hey! Remember that time we were at
							that place and this happened?&rdquo; And suddenly, collectively, that
							memory comes up. And we do that with our notebooks, we do that with
							our phones, but we <em>certainly</em> do that with our rooms, right?
							And I think in terms of your room &ldquo;hurting,&rdquo; thinking of
							that in terms of an extension of yourself and the way you think of
							different parts of <em>yourself</em> hurting. The way you will be
							like, &ldquo;My <em>knee </em> is sore. I need to take care of that,
							because it helps me do things.&rdquo; So that is how I think of my
							room hurting, it&rsquo;s like, feeling sick. <br><br>

							<strong>E2F: And when it&rsquo;s feeling sick, the way that a body
								part is feeling bad, it&rsquo;s not able to help you do the things
								that you do, which is the reason why people want to keep their bodies
								healthy in the first place.</strong><br><br>
							EK: Exactly.<br><br>

							<strong>E2F: Is there anything particular in your room that you are
								drawn to when you enter it? That is a totem for you, that grounds
								you in your space when you see it?</strong><br><br>
							EK: I think as of now, it&rsquo;s definitely my floating plant. I
							feel like that thing embodies so much of what I am as a person,
							just like&hellip;natural harmony with technology.<br><br> <!-- -->
						</p>

						<center> <img src="enayet_plant.png" style="width:50%;" > </center>

						<p>
							<strong>E2F: Totally, and something too about the way that it&rsquo;s like, so
								stable but not fixed. It&rsquo;s in this balance between unmoving and dynamic. </strong><br><br>
								EK: I think this little guy, too&hellip;<br><br>
								So this springy stuff going through it? That stuff is called muscle wire&hellip;and
								this is a piece of Korean linen. When you open it up it&rsquo;s just a flat sheet
								with a little square, and when you run a current through it, the wire wants to
								contract back into a little spring. And there&rsquo;s not a lot to it, but that
								gesture is something that I really like. Curling up, and unfolding, and being
								between those states. <br><br>

								<strong>E2F: It also does have a similar theme to the plant, of the technological
									and the natural. It&rsquo;s this really soft, organic cloth, but you&rsquo;ve
									done this really futuristic thing to it.</strong><br><br>
									EK: The other thing I like about it, is when it droops over time, every once in
									a while, and I&rsquo;ll look at it, and it looks kind of wrong, so I&rsquo;ll
									flip it around and change its orientation. And we&rsquo;ve talked about these
									working moments and these relaxed moments, and everything is in these compartments,
									but here there is this kind of granularity, where this object has these two states,
									a start state and an end state. You can run energy through it and then smooth
									it back out. But it has these in-between states where it&rsquo;s going there,
									and even if you set it to one of those states and leave it, it&rsquo;s still
									in a state of flux.<br><br>

									<strong>E2F: What&rsquo;s your relationship to light in your room?</strong><br><br>
									EK: I&rsquo;m very naturally inclined to be a nocturnal person&mdash;my most
									productive hours are from 10pm-4am. Lighting is a huge part of that. I have daylight
									lighting in here, during those hours. I definitely have brighter lighting during
									work hours, and then when I&rsquo;m relaxing I like <em>hidden</em> light, when
									I relax. <br><br>

									<strong>E2F: Like you can&rsquo;t see the source of it?</strong><br><br>
									EK: Exactly. Overhead lighting is the bane of my existence. It&rsquo;s horrible.
									I find it very confusing when I enter someone&rsquo;s space and they&rsquo;re
									relaxing and they have overhead lights on. I <em>believe</em> that they feel
									like they are relaxing, but&hellip;<br><br>

									<strong>E2F: &hellip;they&rsquo;re lying to themselves?</strong><br><br>
									EK: &hellip;I do find it difficult to understand. <br><br>

									<strong>E2F: And smells? I feel like smells are big for you.</strong><br><br>
									EK: Oh, scents are huge. In terms of function for my room, I have an oil diffuser,
									and I use one thing when I want to feel this way, and one thing when I want to
									feel another way. When I&rsquo;m trying to sleep, I do lavender oil. When I&rsquo;m
									trying to work, my two scents are bergamot and sometimes lemongrass, actually.
									When I&rsquo;m feeling unwell, though&hellip;tea tree oil. It makes me feel like
									my sinuses are getting cleared, and it does have antibacterial properties, so
									it&rsquo;s actually doing something. <br><br>
									It&rsquo;s actually funny, because you gave me a candle, that I use very sparingly,
									for a very specific occasion. Sometimes I do use it when I&rsquo;ve been cooking
									too much. Just to clear everything up. But I also use it as
									my&hellip;long-self-reflection-period kind of candle&hellip;<br><br>

									<strong>E2F: That&rsquo;s amazing! That&rsquo;s so wonderful to hear.</strong><br><br>
									EK: When it&rsquo;s been a month or two since I&rsquo;ve looked at, you know,
									big picture, what I want, just in general, that&rsquo;s my scent. When I need
									to sit down and make some lists, some mental maps&hellip;that&rsquo;s my scent.
									It&rsquo;s warm, but it&rsquo;s also&hellip;sensible.<br><br>

									<strong>E2F: What a great thing to learn through this experience.</strong></p>

										<h2>What Anything Is Ever Becoming </h2>
										<h6>By Faith Harding</h6>

										<p>
											Pandora Radio entered my life when I was 15, when my musical appetite was at
											its most voracious. I devoured songs and albums with a feverish, hormonal gusto
											that most likely was meant to be used for the sex I wasn&rsquo;t having. I remember
											well how Pandora was marketed. This is because I was young, and foolish&mdash;
											and I believed in the promises Pandora made.<br><br>

											They called it the Music Genome Project. Here is how it would work: The good
											scientists at the Music Genome Project would take one of my favorite songs and
											deconstruct it with a shrewd, incisive hand&mdash;beyond decade, beyond genre,
											into its most microscopic parts. Then something would happen with an algorithm.
											Then, the scientists at the Music Genome Project would
											present me with a Customized Radio Station, an unlimited stream of the perfect
											music, music meant just for me, all the songs connected by an invisible golden
											thread of common elements, my deepest sonic wishes fulfilled, until my life&rsquo;s
											end, Amen.&nbsp;<br><br>

											10 years later Pandora Radio is still in my life. I have to use it at my job
											to select inoffensive background music for cafe patrons. Time heals some wounds,
											but I am still deeply disappointed in Pandora Radio for what it has become. It
											is the most limited &ldquo;genre radio&rdquo; radio you can imagine. There is
											still a utopia in my mind, a heaven free from category where I open Pandora
											and start a station for Caetano Veloso&rsquo;s &ldquo;You Don&rsquo;t Know Me,&rdquo;
											and Donna Summer&rsquo;s &ldquo;State of Independence&rdquo; plays next. Or I
											start a Bach station and Joni Mitchell comes up. The associations are obvious
											to me. They are personal and deep. And in this imagining, my radio knows this,
											too. But then there is the reality, where I turn on Beyonce Radio, and I get a
											lazy dump of R&amp;B tunes for half an hour and then a commercial. Sometimes
											I rant about this reality to my coworkers. They shrug.<br><br>

											In a way, they&rsquo;re right to be indifferent. I am mad at Pandora Radio for
											trying to achieve something that I never should have expected them to achieve
											in the first place. They were trying to define taste. They were trying to put
											words to the ineffable. Algorithms can do a lot. But not that.
											<br><br>
											I have always been fascinated by the intensity with which I remember certain
											periods of my life. Some eras are so forgettable that they can barely be called
											eras at all, except to mark them as a sort of Dark Age. But then there are others.
											There is the winter when I was 13, when it rained pretty much every day (in Los
											Angeles!) and I watched <i>Blackadder</i> with a girl I no longer speak to, and I was
											figuring out how to play "You Won&rsquo;t See Me" by The Beatles on the shitty
											Yamaha in my bedroom. There is the summer when I was 19, when I worked as a medical
											record editor in a Beverly Hills ENT&rsquo;s office and blasted Samiyam in a
											tiny white Volkswagen Beetle and read the entirety of <i>Lord of The Rings</i> lying
											facedown on the grass in my backyard. There is the spring of 2015, when it
											seemed like the only thing I ever did was smoke weed, listen to this one Photay
											mix, and direct the little boy in the video game <i>Ni No Kuni: Wrath of
												The White Witch</i> through a rich autumn-toned forest with my mouth slacked
												open in the (somehow, still always shocking) discovery of fun.
												<br><br>
												The funny thing is, during all of these fondly recalled periods, something very
												bad was going on. A relationship was falling apart, or being a child of divorce
												was turning into Being a Child of Divorce, or some other experience equal parts
												mundane and traumatic was happening. But I think back on each of these times with
												intoxicating nostalgia. And it is not the details, but the <em>feeling</em> of
												those times that I miss. For each one there is that unique flavor, that sensation
												of memory that is so hard to explain, the one that feels like the beginning of
												a sneeze, or a twitch on a phantom limb. What is that thing? I will think back
												on one of these times, and after reminiscing for a moment, I will ask myself:
												but what is that thing, there? What is that thing that hangs around? I don&rsquo;t
												think there is a word for it. I want it all the more for that.
												<br><br>
												From Eileen Myles&rsquo; novel <i>Inferno</i>: <br><br>
												&ldquo;I learned that a Bhakti yogi enters a room full of people and methodically
												moves this thing up and down&mdash;by telling stories and getting everyone to speak
												in unison and chant and sing&mdash;it&rsquo;s kind of like an invisible barometer
												he&rsquo;s affecting: the quality of people&rsquo;s togetherness in the room.
												That&rsquo;s the bhav. I felt now that that was my job, to move it.<br><br>
												I&rsquo;m also saying that a life has a bhav. A day has one. A poem is charting
												that. Perhaps giving the sweetest documentation of what anything is ever becoming.&rdquo;
<br><br>

												I freaked out a little bit when I first read this passage. I thought I&rsquo;d
												found that word that had eluded me for years. I looked up &ldquo;bhav&rdquo; as
												soon as I got home. I wanted to know everything about it. I wanted to sit in
												this word and look around. But as I delved into my research, I soon realized
												that this word did not really have the meaning that I thought it did. It actually
												has multiple meanings. &ldquo;Spiritual feeling.&ldquo; &ldquo;Devotion.&rdquo; Sometimes,
												just &ldquo;attitude.&rdquo; Any attitude. &ldquo;How one views God.&rdquo; &ldquo;
												Total orgasm with the universe.&rdquo; Someone on Urban Dictionary provides a
												useful sentence example: &ldquo;I have finally reached the state of Bhav. I need
												new pants.&rdquo;
												<br><br>

												This was disappointing for a good moment or two. I certainly had the thought
												that Myles had selected the wrong word, that she had made a mistake. But then
												I remembered that this was Eileen Myles. Not someone who makes mistakes with
												words. Or at least, not accidental mistakes. In fact, this is what I had loved
												about reading her book. Her words were consciously inexact. Just off the mark,
												yet somehow replacing the original target. The vagueness was the point. The
												vagueness pointed to the weird and slippery of experience more than any focused
												language could. Bhav was the right word precisely because it wasn&rsquo;t. The
												wrong word as the right word. Don&rsquo;t you wonder what Hemingway would think
												of that. When I read Hemingway in high school, I loved him, because he made me
												feel like I was in control of my experiences. Then I experienced a lot of anxiety
												from that assumption. Now I am more into Virginia Woolf.
												<br><br>

												Speaking of being someone who is &ldquo;into&rdquo; something: What are we trying
												to attain when we identify with a subculture, when we claim our allegiance to one
												genre or another? For some, it&rsquo;s safety, a sense of belonging, often a survival
												tactic&mdash;I get that. But what about when it&rsquo;s not? What&rsquo;s up with &ldquo;Disco
												Sucks?&rdquo; What&rsquo;s up with &ldquo;Techno Interests Me?&rdquo; What are
												we trying to congeal in ourselves? What are we trying to hold on to? What have
												I been trying to hold on to, at those times in my life when I have attempted to
												settle my restless identity in the world of bebop or house? Maybe it&rsquo;s just
												me, but it never works the way I want it to. It never has. I am looking for something
												there, and by the time I ask for it to stay for a while, it&rsquo;s gone. I am
												looking for the thing that first woke up in me when I heard Clifford Brown or
												Theo Parrish. But how can you ask to be constantly awakening? Pandora Radio, I
												am looking for the Constantly Awakening Station. Bhav Radio.
												The-Sweetest-Documentation-Of-What-Anything-Is-Ever-Becoming-Wave. Yesterday I
												heard it in an open high hat. But I checked again today and now it just sounds
												like metal.
												<br><br>

												Solidity is an illusion. I know this sounds like a shitty thought I had sophomore
												year of college, deep in a Vyvanse haze, but it&rsquo;s not. Solidity&mdash;actually&mdash;is
												an illusion. It&rsquo;s one of those things they tell you in high school science
												and then give you no time to think about, because you have to move onto the math.
												But I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it more lately. When I&rsquo;m sitting on the
												subway I think about the feeling of my butt against the plastic seat and I imagine
												it as energy pushing against energy. I mean, I don&rsquo;t imagine it. Because
												that&rsquo;s what it is. I see it for what it is. And it excites me. It feels
												like when I first learned about Pandora Radio or when I first read that passage
												in <i>Inferno</i>. This excitement is intoxicating. You want be there as
												long as you can. Just sitting still. Butt on the plastic seat of the universe.
												But that is a very tricky desire. Then you are trying to make that thing you
												loved for not being solid, solid. Now it&rsquo;s gone. Now you&rsquo;ve hurt
												its feelings.
												<br><br>

												I don&rsquo;t think it is solidity that we want. Though we think we do. Solidity
												doesn&rsquo;t excite us. Solidity is the disappointing conclusion, the demise caused
												by our own impotence of perception. I think what excites us is when we, for a moment,
												glimpse past that near-constant illusion, when we see the vibration that makes up
												the so-called matter of our lives. When we feel the static flicker of a song or a
												memory, and it hovers in front of us, a translucent tease of realness. We want more
												than anything, to find this realness beyond the real. Which, all things considered,
												is actually the easy part. But then we want to bring it back with us. And keep it.
												Store it in a tupperware so it stays fresh, while we look for the word, for the
												equation that pins it down. Well, tough shit. You can&rsquo;t have everything you
												want. Pandora taught me that.</p>

											<h2>E2F Production Tip</h2>

											<p>When listening back to a track, looking at the Ableton screen can become a bit of
												a distraction and can stop you from paying attention to the sound of the mix alone.
												Try this exercise: Before beginning playback, turn the brightness on your computer
												all the way down. Then turn off all the lights in your room and close your
												blackout curtains. Slowly remove all of your clothes and create with them a soft
												surface to lie on. Cover your body LIBERALLY with a ROOM TEMPERATURE oil. Close
												your eyes and pay attention to your breathing. Try to slow it down as much as
												possible, moving from a deep to a shallow movement. Try to make it as shallow as
												possible. Soon, you will notice you are not breathing at all. Notice if you still
												even feel yourself inside your own body. No? That&rsquo;s right, you are no longer
												a body, you are void of person. You are free of both your objecthood and subjecthood.
												There is nothing left to create, and nothing left to listen to. You are finally
												liberated. Congratulations.
